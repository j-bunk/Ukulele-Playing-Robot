# ðŸ¤–ðŸª• Description 
We designed and built a ukulele playing :). It included an arm that would strum a pick across the strings, an arm that would change and apply chords, a user interface to let listeners choose which song they wanted, and a stand for all the above to be held on. We also 3D printed a configurable box that we used on our chord arm design and laser cut gears (that are now being used a coffee coasters). Over the course of two months, these main parts were assembled, and the necessary software was written to control them.
